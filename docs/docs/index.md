# Single sample pathway analysis toolkit
sspa provides a Python interface for metabolomics pathway analysis. In addition to conventional methods over-representation analysis (ORA) and gene/metabolite set enrichment analysis (GSEA), it also provides a wide range of single-sample pathway analysis (ssPA) methods. 

## Features
- Over-representation analysis
- Metabolite set enrichment analysis (based on GSEA)
- Single-sample pathway analysis
- Compound identifier conversion
- Pathway database download (KEGG, Reactome, and MetExplore metabolic networks)

Although this package is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for metabolomics pathway analysis, the methods are also applicable to other datatypes such as normalised RNA-seq data. 

## Installation
```
pip install sspa
```
